As part of the New York Times' indexing procedures, most articles are manually
summarized and tagged by a staff of library scientists. This collection contains
over 650,000 article-summary pairs which may prove to be useful in the development
and evaluation of algorithms for automated document summarization. Also, over
1.5 million documents have at least one tag. Articles are tagged for persons,
places, organizations, titles and topics using a controlled vocabulary that is
applied consistently across articles. For instance if one article mentions "Bill
Clinton" and another refers to "President William Jefferson Clinton", both articles
will be tagged with "CLINTON, BILL".
